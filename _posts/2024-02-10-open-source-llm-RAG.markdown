title: "Open Source LLM (RAG Retrieval Augmented Generation)"
date: 2024-02-12
categories: AI releases
---

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances the capabilities of generative models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), by integrating them with a retrieval component. This approach allows the model to dynamically access and incorporate external knowledge sources into its responses. By querying a vast database or corpus of documents in real-time, RAG models can pull in relevant information, facts, or data that were not part of their initial training data. This process significantly improves the model's ability to provide accurate, informative, and contextually rich answers to a wide variety of queries, making it especially useful for applications requiring up-to-date information or deep domain knowledge.
