<p>The excitement around open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) took off in February 2023 when Meta introduced LLaMa to the academic world. This event marked the beginning of a new era with the creation of smaller LLMs, known as ‘sLLMs’, which typically range from 6 billion (6B) to 10 billion (10B) parameters. These models are notable for their cost-effectiveness and efficiency, offering a viable alternative to larger models like OpenAI’s GPT-4, which boasts about 1.7 trillion parameters.</p>
