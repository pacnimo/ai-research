This approach allows the model to dynamically access and incorporate external knowledge sources into its responses. By querying a vast database or corpus of documents in real-time, RAG models can pull in relevant information, facts, or data that were not part of their initial training data. This process significantly improves the model’s ability to provide accurate, informative, and contextually rich answers to a wide variety of queries, making it especially useful for applications requiring up-to-date information or deep domain knowledge.</p>

<p>As we advance into 2024, the impact of open-source LLMs in shaping the future of AI and technology cannot be overstated. Their influence spans across innovation, accessibility, education, economic viability, and technical robustness, heralding a new era of growth and opportunity in the AI sector.</p>

<p>The excitement around open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) took off in February 2023 when Meta introduced LLaMa to the academic world. This event marked the beginning of a new era with the creation of smaller LLMs, known as ‘sLLMs’, which typically range from 6 billion (6B) to 10 billion (10B) parameters. These models are notable for their cost-effectiveness and efficiency, offering a viable alternative to larger models like OpenAI’s GPT-4, which boasts about 1.7 trillion parameters.</p>
